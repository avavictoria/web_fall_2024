        <h2>Once upon a time...</h2>
    </div>
    
    <p>In a small, forgotten town, nestled between dark woods and a winding river, there stood an old, abandoned house. The locals whispered about it, claiming it was cursed. They said it was once the home of a reclusive artist named Marina, whose paintings depicted nightmarish scenes that seemed to come alive.</p>
    <p>One Halloween night, a curious group of friends dared each other to explore the house. They armed themselves with flashlights, laughing as they approached the creaking front door. The air was thick with an unsettling silence, broken only by the rustle of leaves in the wind.</p>
    <p>As they stepped inside, the musty smell of decay filled their lungs. Dust danced in the beams of their flashlights, illuminating strange shapes on the walls—Marina's haunting paintings. Eyes seemed to follow them as they moved deeper into the house, each room revealing more of her twisted imagination.</p>
    <p>In one room, they found an unfinished canvas propped against the wall. The painting depicted a moonlit scene with a shadowy figure lurking at the edge of a forest. Just as they were about to leave, one of the friends, Elise, felt a chill wash over her. She turned to the others, but they were staring at the painting, transfixed.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, the figure in the painting began to shift. It seemed to step forward, its eyes glowing like embers. Panicking, Elise grabbed her friends, but they were frozen, their gazes locked on the canvas. “We have to go!” she cried, but her voice echoed back at her, as if the house itself were mocking her.</p>
    <p>As the figure in the painting stretched its shadowy limbs, a cold wind swept through the room, setting out their flashlights. Darkness enveloped them. Elise stumbled backward, desperately trying to reach the door, but the floorboards creaked ominously, as if the house were alive, holding them captive.</p>
    <p>In the pitch black, she felt a hand brush against her arm. “Help!” she screamed, but no sound came from her friends. They were gone, swallowed by the shadows. Heart racing, she sprinted toward the door, her mind racing with visions of the figure in the painting.</p>
    <p>Finally bursting through the door, she stumbled outside, gasping for breath. She turned back to look at the house, but it was silent, as if it had never been there. The friends she had known just moments before had vanished, leaving only echoes of their laughter hanging in the air.</p>
    <p>Weeks passed, and the town remained unchanged, but Elise knew the truth. Every night, she saw Marina's painting in her dreams—the figure now closer, its eyes burning with desire. She realized that the house had claimed her friends, and soon, it would come for her too.</p>
    <p>On Halloween night, when the moon hung low and full, the townsfolk heard her screams echoing through the woods, a chilling reminder that some places should remain undisturbed, and some stories are best left untold.</p>
